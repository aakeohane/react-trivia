# Quizzical

Solo project to further test my React skills and become even more familiar with JSX syntax, similar to React Pokedex, the quiz app calls from the Open Trivia Database and generates random trivia questions for the user to answer. I later implemented a component to allow the user to alter their preferences for the quiz category, difficulty and amount of questions.

Project: [Quizzical](https://aakeohane.github.io/react-trivia/)

## Features ✅

- Quiz Data is loaded from [the Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php)
- Each question is rendered to the DOM along with multiple choice answers rendered as reusable component buttons
- This was a side project from [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/)
- Scrimba provided the [Figma mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/E9S5iPcm10f0RIHK8mCqKL/Quizzical-App?node-id=0%3A1) for the design for me to develop
- The code was 100% developed by myself, solutions were not given
- useEffect hook is used to avoid side effects while fetching JSON data in addition to storing my initial state for the quiz questions

## Technologies

- React
- JSX
- Figma
- CSS

## Final Reflections

I built this project to really solidify my understanding of React. I used functional components as opposed to class components as this is a much preferred method for me.

The styling was designed by Scrimba via Figma and it was my job to develop it into a working application. I thought this was great practice if I were to work with designers and then also implement the working code succesfully.

I can't say that this was easy for me as it was much more complicated than my Pokedex project which was relatively straightforward. I had to come up with solutions by googling and followed by heavy research. If that didnt help, thankfully, I would wake up at 4am with the solution because I cant seem to turn off my mind with a problem unsolved. There may be better ways to approach some of the problems, and am always open to criticism, however I am very proud of my personal growth with this project.
