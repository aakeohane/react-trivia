# Quizzical

Solo project to further test my React skills and become even more familiar with JSX syntax, similar to React Pokedex, the quiz app calls from the Open Trivia Database and generates random trivia questions for the user to answer.

Project: [Quizzical](https://aakeohane.github.io/react-trivia/)

## Features âœ…

- Quiz Data is loaded from [the Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php)
- Each random question is rendered to the DOM along with multiple choice answers rendered as reusable component buttons
- This was a side project from [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/)
- Scrimba provided the [Figma mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/E9S5iPcm10f0RIHK8mCqKL/Quizzical-App?node-id=0%3A1) for the design for me to develop
- The code was 100% developed by myself, solutions were not given
- useEffect hook is used to avoid side effects while fetching JSON data in addition to storing my initial state for the quiz questions

## Technologies

- React
- JSX
- Figma
- CSS

## Final Reflections

I built this project to really solidify my understanding of React. I used functional components again as this is much preferred.

The styling was designed by Scrimba via Figma and it was my job to develop it into a working application. I thought this was great practice if I were to work with designers and then also implement the working code succesfully.

I can't say that this was easy for me as it was much more complicated than the Pokedex project which was relatively straightforward. I had to come up with solutions by googling and if that didnt help, thankfully, I would wake up at 4am with the solution out of nowhere. There may be better ways to approach some of the problems, however I am very proud of my personal growth with this project.
